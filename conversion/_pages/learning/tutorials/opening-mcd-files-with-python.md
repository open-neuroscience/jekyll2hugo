This is a small piece of python code that converts *.mcd filesÂ  (electrophysiology data as recorded from the multichannelsystems rig, using their MCRack software) into python.

This code was created using python 2.7 and the neuroshare bindings for python from http://pythonhosted.org/neuroshare/

[code language=&#8221;python&#8221;]

#Function to get all the analog entities from the *.mcd files

#created by the MCRack software from multichannelsystems.

#It takes the complete file path as input and returns a

#dictionary containing the name of each channel as a key and

#its contents as values (numpy arrays)

#for this to work, the following libraries for python must be installed:

#neuroshare bindings from http://pythonhosted.org/neuroshare/

#numpy
