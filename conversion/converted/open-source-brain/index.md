The [open source brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/) project is a database of computational models of neural systems.Â  From the website:

> **Open Source Brain** is a resource for sharing and collaboratively developing  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience" target="_blank">computational models of neural systems</a>. (&#8230;)

> OSB will provide advanced facilities to analyse, visualise and transform models (&#8230;), and to connect researchers interested in models of specific neurons, brain regions and disease states.
